function [Eye_Pos]= EyePosition_FUNC(Frame)
%% This function locates pupils in a picture of a face
%
% inputs:
% Frame - frame to locate eyes in. the frame is expected to be a grayscale
% image.
% outputs:
% Eye_pos - 2X2 matrix. row one contains location of left eye x and y
% coordinates respectivly, row two is the same for right eye.

Eye_Pos = [x_L-30 y_L-32; x_R-30 y_R-32]; % the -32 and -30 on x and y coordinates are because the maximum value of the corelation function is given at the bottom right of the refference picture and we correct it to the pupils which are at the center of the refference
